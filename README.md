ansible-module-devel
====================

This is where my work on ansible modules will be done before submitting PRs to https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras

#####Current module dev:
- Windows
  - `win_acl`
    - set file/directory permissions for user/group
  - `win_host`
    - host renaming and domain joining
  - `win_pscx`
    - install pscx (if needed), runs pscx commands
  - `win_s3`
    - download/upload to aws_s3
  - `win_timezone`
    - machine timezone setting via tzutil
  - `win_unzip`
    - unzip compressed files/folders
  - `win_zip`
    - compress files/folders

#####To use in your playbooks:
From your root directory (Where you run your playbooks from):
```
	mkdir library && cd library
	git clone https://github.com/schwartzmx/ansible-module-devel.git
```
And that is it... You should be able to use the modules.  Ansible should be able to find them.
